 * The result returned by {@link IntraproceduralDataflowAnalysis#run(BasicBlock)}.

 * <p>The result can be either a {@link SuccessfulDataflowAnalysisResult}, which represents the fact

 * {@link FailedDataflowAnalysisResult}, in which case the dataflow analysis was aborted before a
 * fixpoint was reached.

 * <p>The result currently does not hold any data about the result of the analysis, but this would
